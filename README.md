# YARE-py
**Y**et **A**nother **R**GSSAD **E**xtractor, now in python.

I know, something like this already exists elsewhere.

This repository is **Work in Progress**. That means I'm a lazy clump of moss and would update it from time to time.

If you dare enough to use it, you would need Python 3+.
Are there any benefits of using this over other extractors out there?
Well it worked on the archive on which others failed.


*It's more like "can I do this" project then anything else.*

*This is not a Jojo refrence.*
