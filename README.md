# YARE-py
**Y**et **A**nother **R**GSSAD **E**xtractor, now in python.

I know, something like this already exists elsewhere.

This repository is **Work in Progress**. That means I'm a lazy clump of moss and would update it from time to time.

If you dare enough to use it, you would need Python 3+.
Are there any benefits of using this over other extractors out there?
Well it worked on the archive on which others failed.

**How to install**
1. Again, you need Python 3. Go grab it from their website
  * for Android use QPython
2. Download this repo and unzip wherever you like
3. Move onto **Usage** step

**How  to use**
1. On windows, *shift-right-click* inside the folder where you unzipped the repo.
  * click "Open command prompt" on the menu
  * type `python for-windows.py [your_file_name] (output_folder)`. Note that we don't support reading and extracting archives to folders other than the script folder and it's subfolders.
  * if you done everything correctly, it should output some stuff into the console and evetually finish extracting.
2. On android (and possibly Linux), run the `for-android.py` file, it should walk you though.
  * I suggest unzipping the repository into `qpython/projects3/` folder on your internal storage for easy access. You still would need to run it manually though. Just open the editor, navigate to the unzipped folder, open `for-android.py`.
  * Don't forget to put your files into the same folder as the unzipped repository.



*It's more like "can I do this" project then anything else.*

*This is not a Jojo refrence.*
