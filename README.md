# YARE-py
**Y**et **A**nother **R**GSSAD **E**xtractor, now in Python.

I know, something like this already exists elsewhere, but their version is messy.

This repository is **Work in Progress**. That means I'm a lazy clump of moss and would update it from time to time.

If you dare enough to use it, you would need Python 3+.
<br>Are there any benefits of using this over other extractors out there?
Well it worked on the archive on which others failed.

**How to install**
1. Again, you need Python 3. Go grab it from their website
  * for Android use QPython
2. Download this repo and unzip wherever you like
3. Move onto **Usage** step

**How  to use**
<br>There are two versions of it: `app-prompt.py` and `app-told.py`.
  * `app-prompt.py` is more user-friendly: you run it and it asks you for things it needs. **Keep  in mind** that it can only detect game archives that are *inside of the script folder*. I suggest using it on Android since you can't specify command-line arguments there.
  * `app-told.py` takes options it needs from command-line arguments. Run `app-told.py -h` for some bit of help. If you don't know what are those, use `app-prompt.py`.

*It's more like "can I do this" project then anything else.*

*This is not a Jojo refrence.*
